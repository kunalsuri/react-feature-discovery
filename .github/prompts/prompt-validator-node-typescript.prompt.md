# 🧠 Prompt: Codebase Maturity Audit Review & Optimization

## 🎯 Objective
Assess whether the current prompt file **`codebase-maturity-audit.prompt.md`** is suitable for this project context:

- **Project Type:** TypeScript / Node.js CLI + Web GUI  
- **Purpose:** Read-only static analysis of React codebases  

If it’s overly verbose or references irrelevant tools (e.g., Vite, frontend build configs), revise it to better fit a **CLI + HTTP server architecture**.

---

## 🧩 Task
As an expert **DevOps engineer** and **prompt architect**, refine the maturity audit prompt to:

1. Focus on **TypeScript quality**, **CLI modularity**, and **React static analysis**.
2. Remove checks irrelevant to this architecture (e.g., frontend bundlers like Vite).
3. Keep the structure **concise, outcome-driven, and implementation-ready**.
4. Ensure the output remains actionable for code audits and maintainability assessments.

---

## ⚙️ Expected Output
Provide a **clean, minimal, production-grade** version of the maturity audit prompt that:

- Reflects this project’s actual stack and purpose  
- Prioritizes **clarity and relevance** over verbosity  
- Delivers a balanced view of code health, architecture, and maintainability
Return only the revised prompt content without additional explanations or commentary.
